    "To reiterate, speech synthesis has become increasingly sophisticated, with computer-generated voices that can sound remarkably human-like. However, distinguishing between synthetic speech and human speech can still be challenging, especially in scenarios where the quality of the audio signal may be poor or the characteristics of the speakers are highly variable. In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model to classify speech signals as either human or synthetic, based on their acoustic features.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, we will use a dataset of voice recordings that includes samples of both human and synthetic speech. We will preprocess the audio signals to extract a set of relevant features, such as spectral density, pitch, and formant frequencies. We will then train a machine learning model, such as a random forest classifier or a support vector machine (SVM), to classify speech signals as either human or synthetic, based on these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of the model will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We will also conduct a thorough analysis of the model's performance, including a confusion matrix, to determine which classes are being misclassified and whether any particular features are driving the classification decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify speech signals as either human or synthetic, and to gain insights into the underlying features that contribute to this classification. The resulting model could have applications in fields such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and voice authentication, among others."

    "This project aimed to develop a machine learning model to classify speech signals as either human or synthetic based on their acoustic features. Four models, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, and CNN, were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest model showed the best performance, achieving 90% accuracy, precision, and F1 score. The Logistic Regression and SVM models achieved slightly lower scores of 80% in all three metrics. The CNN model achieved an accuracy of 83% and a validation loss of 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note the hardware limitations that were encountered during this project. Our computer was not powerful enough to handle more complex neural networks and struggled with the size of the dataset. This limited our ability to experiment with more advanced architectures and larger datasets and likely hindered the efficacy of the CNN model, which would have likely achieved better results given a more complex model.\n",
    "\n",
    "While our hardware limitations did affect the scope of our experiments, we were still able to achieve promising results in our classification task. With more powerful hardware, it may be possible to further optimize our models and explore more complex neural network architectures. The resulting model could have applications in fields such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and voice authentication, among others. Further improvements could be made to enhance the performance of the models, such as increasing the size of the dataset or exploring other machine learning algorithms."

    "1. Apply transfer learning from established machine learning models: Instead of training a machine learning model from scratch, consider using transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models on large datasets such as ImageNet or SpeechCommand. This approach can significantly reduce the amount of data and time required for training, and improve the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "2. Increase the size and diversity of the dataset: Collecting a larger and more diverse dataset that includes different accents, languages, and genders can improve the robustness and accuracy of the machine learning models. This can be achieved by collaborating with institutions, organizations, or online communities to collect a more comprehensive dataset.\n",
    "3. Experiment with more complex neural network architectures: The limited hardware resources during the project prevented us from exploring more complex neural network architectures. With more powerful hardware, it would be worth experimenting with architectures such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), or transformers to improve model accuracy.\n",
    "4. Conduct more extensive hyperparameter tuning: Tuning hyperparameters is essential to optimize the performance of the machine learning models. However, due to the limited computational resources, we were only able to perform a limited amount of tuning. Conducting more extensive hyperparameter tuning could lead to better model performance and more reliable results.\n",
    "5. Explore the impact of different feature extraction techniques: We used a set of standard acoustic features for this project, but there are many other feature extraction techniques that could be explored to improve model performance. For example, deep learning models can be trained end-to-end to learn features directly from raw audio signals, and other features such as spectral contrast, MFCCs, or Mel spectrograms could also be considered."
