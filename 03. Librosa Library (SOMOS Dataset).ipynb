    "Librosa is a Python library that enables users to analyze and process audio signals. It provides tools for loading and saving audio files in various formats, manipulating audio waveforms, and extracting various audio features such as mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), spectral contrast, and chroma features. Librosa also provides tools for visualizing audio data using waveplots, spectrograms, and chroma visualizations, as well as for decomposing audio signals into components such as harmonic and percussive components. \n",
